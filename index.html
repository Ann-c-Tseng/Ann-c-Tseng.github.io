            Beyond my 9 to 5 as a backend software engineer, I <span> experiment </span> and <span> play </span> with creative problem-solving through frontend engineering and user-experience design.
        </h3>
        <p> From freshman year of university till now as a new graduate working in the tech industry, I had the pleasure of working in diverse front-end and user-experience design roles ranging from non-profit and startups, to academic and personal projects.</p>
        <p> Even with my fulltime back-end engineering role, I am still highly persistent in continuing my exploration and learning of front-end engineering and user-experience design skills. Thanks for coming over and exploring what I've got going on!</p>
