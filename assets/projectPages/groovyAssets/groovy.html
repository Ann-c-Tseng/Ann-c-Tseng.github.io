          What are notable preferences and barriers that can impact a student's grocery, meal planning, and budgeting experience?

      <p class="survey_process">
        I included both qualitative (free-response) and quantitative (multiple choice) questions within our survey 
        to see how each user differs in their approach to buying groceries, budgeting, and meal planning. <br>

        Revision of High-fidelity Wireframes
      </h4>
      <p>
        From the above high-fidelity wireframes, I decided to iterate on three main flows: 
        shopping, meal planning, and budgeting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my initial high-fidelity wireframes, many of my colour and font usage were not organized due to lacking a succinct design hierarchy.

        For the new iteration of the shopping, meal planning, and budgeting flows, I simplified down our palette to two colours. I reconsidered our fonts, and created a typography ramp with varying text hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I reiterated the user-flow and aspects of UI elements to further improve the experience and the product's visual cohesion.

        <div class="ihf_strip_right">
          <h4>Grocery Shopping</h4>
          <p>
            For the new shopping flow, the accent green colour is now placed specifically on call-to-action elements. Now users can more
            efficiently and distinctly tell where those elements are simply from a quick glance at the screen. <br><br>

            For the grocery item page ("Apple" screen) and the My Cart page, I brought more attention to the primary buttons and elements on the screen through
            making each of the screen background colour be the primary grey as opposed to the harsh white used in the past. I added tabs
            for listing ingredients and nutritional information when viewing a specific grocery item. Additionally, for the My Cart screen I enlarged 
            the Pickup and Delivery buttons for greater visibility.

        <div class="ihf_strip_right">
          <h4>Meal Planning</h4>
          <p>
            For the new Meal Planning flow, each day of the week is now accessible through selection buttons at the top of the screen, as opposed to students needing to scroll to access each day in the previous design iteration. 
            Now students can quickly navigate between days and weeks from the top of the screen. <br><br>
 
            I made the background our primary grey to visually bring out the meal card elements more. 
            I placed our main "add a plan" button more prominently at the bottom right of the screen for students to access that easily. 
            Since our weekly & daily plans can be accessed at the top of the screen, the calendar button that used to be next to the "add a plan" button can be removed completely.

        <div class="ihf_strip_right">
          <h4>Budgeting</h4>
          <p>
            For this new iteration of the budgeting flow, I redesigned the weekly spending display to be a visual circle as opposed to the previous design's pie-chart so that users can now
            quickly understand their weekly spendings with a simple glance. <br><br>

            I redesigned the Weekly Activities bar graph to show the exact amount of dollars spent per category, as opposed to the older design's percentage measurement. 
            Dollar amount brings more clarity and a concrete understanding to a user's money spending. <br><br>

            I added a new "Detailed Transactions" screen to the budgeting flow to allow users a greater understanding of their monthly spending, and to give a clear list of their 
            past transactions. This was not in the prior design iteration, but is quite a necessary addition to a student's budgeting experience.

      <h4>
        What I Learned
      </h4>
      <p>
        Grocery purchases, planning, and budgeting can vary diversely between our users. I aimed to create a solution to allow our users the 
        flexibility and efficiency of addressing their particular need, whether that be all experiences this product has to offer or portions of it. 
        Through iterating on specific flows of our solution multiple times, this greatly allowed me to further think through our users' experiences 
        within that particular aspect of our overall solution.

      <h4>
        Future Improvements
      </h4>
      <p>
        In the future I would want to achieve a majority of our respondents to be university students within our research, 
        and to incorporate more user interviews within a design cycle. Through doing so, we could gather more feedback on our
        design and iterate further on those reviews.
